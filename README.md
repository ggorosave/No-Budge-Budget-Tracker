## Description
No Budge is a simple budget tracker meant for anyone interested in keeping a closer eye on their finances. It’s a full stack application that showcases our abilities to create and implement a database, a server, and facilitate the user experience with a clean and easy to navigate interface. We built this application using the following technologies: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars), [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), [Express Session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session), [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), [Bycrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), and of course, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We used the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5) framework and the application was deployed through [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Usage
[Deployed Site](https://no-budge.herokuapp.com/chart-view)<br>
Either create an account or if you have done so already, login to your account. On the left hand side, add a name for your transaction, the amount of the transaction and select a category. You can also add your own custom category (or see ones others have created) to customize your budget tracking for your needs. Once you have added your transaction, it will appear on the right side under the category you have selected. The break-down of your spending in a doughnut style chart can be found by clicking the 'Chart View' button in the header. This will give you a great visual to see where you're spending the most or spending the least in your categories. Another way to keep track of your budget is by reflecting on your previous spending to compare where you were to where you are now, you can do this by clicking the 'Past Reports' button in the header. Always stay on top of your spending, set goals and have a streamlined way to do that by using No Budget Budget Tracker.<br>
